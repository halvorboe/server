# Server
How to configure the server and useful scripts.

## 1. Install Ubuntu

With "terrahost" this is easy. Should not take long.

## 2. Configure SSH 

### 2.1 Create a user

The first step to setting up SSH is making it safe, so that you don't loose access to your server. To do this the first step is setting up a user that is not root. 

### 2.2 Sharing keys between your local machine and the server

The best way is probably using ssh-copy-id. Will try using this link.
